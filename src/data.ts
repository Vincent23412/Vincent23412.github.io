  intro:
    "I’m a master’s student in Computer Science at National Chengchi University. Through coursework and multiple projects, I’ve built a strong foundation in backend development, data processing, and system architecture. I’m proficient in Node.js and TypeScript, and have delivered end-to-end backend services with Express and Prisma. In data engineering, I’ve designed ETL pipelines, performed data cleaning, and optimized processing workflows. Recently, I’ve expanded into cloud infrastructure and distributed systems, with hands-on experience in Docker, Kubernetes, and Linux. I also build concurrent, scalable backend modules in Go.",
